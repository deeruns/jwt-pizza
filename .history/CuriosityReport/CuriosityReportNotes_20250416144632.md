**Spotify DevOps**

*Notes:*
Spotify Engineering Culture:
* "Agile" engineering companuy
 * Principles are better than practices, rules are not alwasy concretely followed
    * break rules when needed
* each team has an end to end responsibility, spread out for each team across the app
    * they have a mission, strategy, and are in charge of working together and delivering
* autonomy makes things fast, so people are motivated and can work together fast
* Be autonomous, but don't sacrifice the whole app goal
* leaders tell the teams what to do, but they have to figure our how to solve it: Aligned autonomy
* the more aligned you are the more autonomy there is
*There are over 100 different systems, coded and deployed independently, but each system focuses on one things
* internal open source model that all squads use, and anyone can edit (with reviews)
* 91% enjoy working there, their focus is for everyone to be happy
* Community > structure
* they encourage small frequent releases and test automation
* Feature Squads, Infrastructure squads, and Client App Squads
*decoupled releases 
* they do releases every week or every 3 weeks: even if the code is incomplete, they have a toggle to hide it,
but this allows them to find bugs easier
* trust over control
Spotify failures
* Fail fast, learn fast, improve fast
* fail friendly
* limited blast radius, so the failures will only affect a small part of the app, being worked on by that squad
* gradual rollout with only a few users
* gives squads courage to try new things very fast, if youre under control youre going to slow
* Lean startup
    * ideas -> narrative/prototype -> MVP -> test -> (tweak, release, analyze)
* innovation over predictability
* People are encouraged to have 10% of their time as "hack" time, to expiriment on whatever they want
* expiriment friendly Culture
* data driven decision
* if it works, keep it, if it doesn't work, throw it away
* no big projects, just smaller efforts
* if big projects, visualize progress, and daily meetings to figure out dependencies
* healthy culture heals broken process
